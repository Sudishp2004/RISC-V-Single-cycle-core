This project presents the design and verification of a 32-bit RISC-V single-cycle processor implemented in Verilog. The processor follows the RV32I instruction set subset and includes a modular datapath, control unit, ALU, register file, and instruction/data memory interface.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate fundamental processor design concepts such as instruction decoding, arithmetic and logical execution, memory operations, and branch control, all executed within a single clock cycle. Functional correctness is validated through simulation waveforms and test programs.

This project highlights skills in digital design, computer architecture, RTL development, and hardware verification, making it suitable for roles in VLSI, ASIC design, and hardware engineering.
